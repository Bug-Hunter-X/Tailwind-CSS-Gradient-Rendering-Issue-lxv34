# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradient rendering.  In certain scenarios, gradients may not render correctly, appearing as solid colors or showing banding artifacts.

## Problem
The `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` class in the provided HTML may render incorrectly depending on the browser and color similarity.  This is because of limitations in browser gradient support or if the `from` and `to` colors are too close in hue.

## Solution
The solution involves using more distinct colors or employing fallback mechanisms to ensure proper rendering across different browsers.
