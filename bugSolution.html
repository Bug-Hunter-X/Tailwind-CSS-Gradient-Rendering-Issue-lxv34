```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-cyan-500 to-teal-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This solution uses three colors (`from`, `via`, `to`) to create a more distinct gradient.  The intermediate color (`via`) helps smooth out transitions, reducing the likelihood of banding.  Alternatively, a fallback color could be included in CSS using `background-color` as a failsafe.
